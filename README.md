# grow-together-app
An app made for hosting NGOs and individuals interested in charity

Problem-
People who want to volunteer for a social cause but don’t have the time to commit to an organization full-time are unable to find where and whom to approach. 
Also, individuals or organizations/NGOs who want volunteers for a specific event but are unable to find them every time.

Solution-
We want to create a platform where volunteers and organizers can interact freely. All the events happening will be listed at one place and the users can then choose to volunteer for any of them. With our app,we will be helping start-up NGO's and also can help with the problem of growing starvation-deaths and food wastage.
This app can be used by anyone wanting to help others ranging from the retired population or home-makers to college students looking to volunteer.
Features-
    • Two types of accounts for signing up-
        → Organization- For registered NGOs and corporate
        → Volunteer- For any individual.
    • For posting a notice, there will be two categories-
        → Events- Which have already been planned with the respective details of date time and venue.
        → Issues- Which need to be organised.
    • THE CHAT BOX
        Interested users would be directly be sent to the specific chat box to contact the organiser and other interested volunteers once they show their interest.Chatbox will be a temporary feature,which will automatically dissolve after the event.Will also have a report feature.
  Workflow-
     • Organizer client on signing up/signing-in will be able to post about an event by filling necessary details.They will be able to reach potential clients via group chat.
     • Volunteer client on signing up/signing-in will be taken to the main page which will have listing of various charity events with details like date,time,place and issue.For further details,they can personally contact the host via a built-in group chat.
