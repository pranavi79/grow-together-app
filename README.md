# grow-together-app
An app made hosting NGOs and individuals interested in charity

Problem-
People who want to volunteer for a social cause but also don’t have the time to commit to an organization full-time are unable to find where and whom to approach. 
Also, individuals or organizations/NGOs want volunteers for a specific event are unable to find it every time.

Solution-
We want to create a platform where volunteers and organizers can interact freely. All the events happening will be listed at one place and the users can then choose to volunteer for any of them. 
This app can be used by anyone wanting to help others ranging from retired personnel or home-makers at home to college students looking to volunteer on weekends to NGO start-ups.
Features-
    • Two types of accounts for signing up-
        → Organization- For registered NGOs and corporate
        → Volunteer- For any individual.
    • For posting a notice, there will be two categories-
        → Events- Which have already been planned with the respective details of date time and venue.
        → Issues- Which need to be organised.
    • THE CHAT BOX
        Interested users would be directly be sent to the specific chat box to contact the organiser and other interested volunteers once they show their interest.
